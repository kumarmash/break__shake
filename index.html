      <p>
        The purpose of Break__shake is to document the food, food stories,
        culture, and tourism of different parts of India on a single platform.

        The purpose of this blog is to encourage people to <em>step out of their
        routines and enjoy their personal lives.</em> This can be done by either
        exploring new places, trying new, tasty foods or cooking some
        scrumptious tasting treats in their own kitchen.
