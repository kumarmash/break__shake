      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Rawa dhokla is a popular snack from the western Indian state of Gujarat.
        It is made from rawa, or semolina, which is mixed with yogurt and spices
        to form a batter. The batter is then steamed in a special dhokla mold or
        steamer until it is cooked through. Rawa dhokla is typically served with
        a chutney or sauce on top, and it is often garnished with chopped
        coriander leaves. It is light, fluffy, and has a slightly sour taste due
        to the yogurt. Rawa dhokla is often eaten as a snack or as part of a
        meal.

      <h3>Method</h3>
      <h4>For Dhokla</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Take buttermilk in a bowl. Add rawa to it.</li>
        <li>
          Mix continuously as you add rawa, so that no lumps form. Now add salt
          to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Keep the batter at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add soda/eno to the batter when you are about to cook it.</li>
        <li>
          Take a cooker and fill 2 glasses of water in it and place a stand
          under it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grease a container all over with ghee and pour the batter into it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the tin inside the cooker and steam it for 35-40 min at medium
          flame.
        </li>
        <li>Be sure to remove the whistle and gasket from the cooker.</li>
        <li>
          Check with a spoon or knife. If it comes out clean, it's ready...
          otherwise, give it more time.
        </li>
        <li>Take out the dhokla from the tin and cut it into square pieces.</li>

      <h4>For Tadka</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a pan and heat it.</li>
        <li>
          Once the mustard seeds sizzle, add the curry leaves and green
          chillies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now add a pinch of turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt as per
          taste.
        </li>
        <li>Add the dhoklas and mix them well.</li>
        <li>
          Garnish it with corriander, green chilli and serve it with Tamarind
